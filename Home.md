Welcome to the wiki for [TerraFERMA](http://terraferma.github.io), the *Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler*!

TerraFERMA is a software system for the  rapid and reproducible construction and exploration of  coupled  multi-physics models.  It leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific computation that provide high level problem description ([FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org)), composable solvers for coupled multi-physics problems ([PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc)) and a science neutral options handling system ([SPuD](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/earthscienceandengineering/research/amcg/spud)) that allows the hierarchical management of all model options.  
  
TerraFERMA inherits most of its functionality from the underlying libraries but adds a layer of control and guidance for building reusable and reproducible applications.
