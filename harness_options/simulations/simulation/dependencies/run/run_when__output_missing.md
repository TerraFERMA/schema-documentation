#run_when (output_missing)

CHOICE 

*/simulations/simulation/dependencies/run/run_when::output_missing*

Select when to run.

Run when some specified output is missing.
Note that if no output is required then it will always run.

Can be overridden with the command line force flag, which will force a run (and possibly a build).
