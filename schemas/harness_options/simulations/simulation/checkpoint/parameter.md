#parameter

MULTIPLE (1+) 

attributes: name (string) 

*/simulations/simulation/checkpoint/parameter*

A parameter definition.

Each parameter should have a unique name.

Parameters should specify a value and python code describing how the parameter should be updated.

For example, you may wish to update the finish time of the simulation when picking up for a checkpoint.

* [values](parameter/values "child")

    type: string

    */simulations/simulation/checkpoint/parameter/values*

    A value.  Unlike for parameter sweeps, only a single value should be entered for checkpoints.
    
    The value is input as a string.
    The update python code before should convert them to appropriate types within the input file.

* [update](parameter/update "child")

    type: string

    */simulations/simulation/checkpoint/parameter/update*

    Python code specifying how the input file should be modified to update this parameter.
    
    If no code is provided the parameter will not be modified at this level 
    (but may be modified at other dependency levels).
    
    The values of all the parameters for this simulation will be available to this code using 
    the names given to the parameters above.  They will be formatted as strings and should be converted 
    appropriately within the code.
