#alpha

OPTIONAL 

type: float

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::SNES/snes_type::ls/alpha*

The scalar such that .5*f_{n+1} . f_{n+1} <= .5*f_n . f_n - alpha |p_n . J . f_n|.

We are finding the zero of f() so the one dimensional minimization problem we are 
solving in the line search is minimize .5*f(x_n + lambda*step_direction) . f(x_n + lambda*step_direction)

Defaults to 1.e-4 if unset.
