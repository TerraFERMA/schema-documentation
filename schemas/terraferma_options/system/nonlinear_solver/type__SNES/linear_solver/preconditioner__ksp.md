#preconditioner (ksp)

CHOICE 

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::SNES/linear_solver/preconditioner::ksp*

A ksp preconditioner.

This only makes sense for solves where a different approximated preconditioner
matrix is provided.

NOTE: If you are using a krylov method (cg/gmres) for this preconditioner 
solve you either need to set your tolerances much stricter for it
than in the outer solve (so that the preconditioner is close to an
exact matrix inversion), or use fgmres in the outer solve.
