#factorization_type (full)

CHOICE 

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::SNES/linear_solver/preconditioner::ksp/linear_solver/preconditioner::fieldsplit/composite_type::schur/factorization_type::full*

The full factorization is:

(A00   A01)  = (1           0) (A00   0) (1  A00inv*A01)

(A10   A11)    (A10*A00inv  1) (0     S) (0         1  )

where S = A11 - A10*A00inv*A01. In practice, the full factorization is applied via block triangular solves 
with the grouping L*(D*U).

Upper uses D*U, lower uses L*D, and diag is the diagonal part with the sign of S flipped (because 
this makes the preconditioner positive definite for many formulations, thus allowing the use of KSPMINRES).
