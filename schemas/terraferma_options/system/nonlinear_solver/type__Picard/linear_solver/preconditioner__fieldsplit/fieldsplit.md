Describe the fieldsplits.  Names must be unique within this linear solver.

Fields not included in any parent fieldsplits will be excluded from this fieldsplit 
even if they are described below (a warning will be given).

Fields included in any sibling fieldsplits will be excluded from this fieldsplit
even if they are described below (a warning will be given).
