#schur_preconditioner (diag)

CHOICE 

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::Picard/linear_solver/preconditioner::fieldsplit/composite_type::schur/schur_preconditioner::diag*

The preconditioner for the Schur complement is generated by the block diagonal 
part of the original matrix associated with the Schur complement (i.e. A11).

When solving a saddle point problem, where the A11 block is identically zero, 
using diag as the preconditioner only makes sense when additionally setting the pc to none. 
Usually for saddle point problems one would use a preconditioner of self and pc lsc 
which uses the least squares commutator compute a preconditioner for the Schur 
complement.
