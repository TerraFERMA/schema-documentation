#form (Residual)

type: string

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::Picard/form::Residual*

ufl code form describing a linear residual form (must return a linear form).  
Any system, field or coefficient ufl symbols defined in this options file may be used in this form as well as any symbols 
defined in the preamble, bilinear and linear forms above.

* [ufl_symbol (solver)](form__Residual/ufl_symbol__solver "child")

    type: string

    */system/nonlinear_solver/type::Picard/form::Residual/ufl_symbol::solver*

    The ufl symbol used above to describe a form.  This need only be unique within this nonlinear_solver. 
    No additional symbols will be automatically generated based on this symbol.
