#reference_point

MULTIPLE (0+) CHOICE 

attributes: name (string) 

*/system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/reference_point*

Options for the description of a reference point at which field values are zeroed during each solve 
by the imposition of an internal pointwise Dirichlet boundary condition at the nearest node to the
coordinates specified below.

Names of each reference point (perhaps on different components) must be unique within this field specification.

* [coordinates](reference_point/coordinates.md "child")

    type: floats

    */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/reference_point/coordinates*

    The coordinates of the reference point.  The node nearest these coordinates will be used.

* CHOICE:
    * [sub_components (Subset)](reference_point/sub_components__Subset.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/reference_point/sub_components::Subset*

        Zero a subset of the vector/tensor components at this reference point.

    * [sub_components (All)](reference_point/sub_components__All.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/reference_point/sub_components::All*

        Zero all the vector/tensor components at this reference point.
