#quadrature_rule (default)

CHOICE 

*/system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional/quadrature_rule::default*

The quadrature rule that will be used when integrating the forms.

The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules (in ffc) for triangles and tetrahedra with a degree of
precision less than or equal to six.  Above this 'canonical' will automatically be used.

The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute the quadrature rule which is based on Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped
onto simplices.
