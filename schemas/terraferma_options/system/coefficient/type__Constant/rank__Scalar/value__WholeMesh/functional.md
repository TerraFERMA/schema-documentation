#functional

CHOICE 

type: string

*/system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional*

ufl code and symbol describing a functional.  This must return a single number, which is used to set a spatially constant coefficient value.

* [ufl_symbol (functional)](functional/ufl_symbol__functional "child")

    type: string

    */system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional/ufl_symbol::functional*

    The ufl symbol used above to describe a functional.  This need not be unique as it is only accessible
    from this description.  No additional symbols will be automatically generated based on this symbol.

* [quadrature_degree](functional/quadrature_degree "child")

    OPTIONAL 

    type: integer

    */system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional/quadrature_degree*

    The quadrature degree that will be used to compute the form.
    
    If unselected ffc will automatically determine the degree for the form.

* CHOICE:
    * [quadrature_rule (default)](functional/quadrature_rule__default "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional/quadrature_rule::default*

        The quadrature rule that will be used when integrating the forms.
        
        The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules (in ffc) for triangles and tetrahedra with a degree of
        precision less than or equal to six.  Above this 'canonical' will automatically be used.
        
        The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute the quadrature rule which is based on Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped
        onto simplices.

    * [quadrature_rule (canonical)](functional/quadrature_rule__canonical "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional/quadrature_rule::canonical*

        The quadrature rule that will be used when integrating the forms.
        
        The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute the quadrature rule which is based on Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped
        onto simplices.
        
        The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules (in ffc) for triangles and tetrahedra with a degree of
        precision less than or equal to six.  Above this 'canonical' will automatically be used.
