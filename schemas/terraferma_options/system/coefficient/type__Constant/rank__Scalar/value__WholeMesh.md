#value (WholeMesh)

*/system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh*

Options for the description of an expression over the domain

* CHOICE:
    * [functional](value__WholeMesh/functional "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: string

        */system/coefficient/type::Constant/rank::Scalar/value::WholeMesh/functional*
