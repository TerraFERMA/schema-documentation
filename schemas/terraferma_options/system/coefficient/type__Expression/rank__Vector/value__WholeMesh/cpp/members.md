type: string

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Vector/value::WholeMesh/cpp/members*

Private members of this expression. These are variables that will be used in the eval
function for this expression but that you don't want initialized at every call to the eval
(expensive).  They should therefore be declared here and initialized in the initialization 
routines below.

The use of underscores at the end of variable names is discouraged as these are frequesntly used for 
automatically generated variables.  Additionally the overloaded dolfin eval interface provides
variables named values, x and cell, so these should not be used to avoid confusion.
