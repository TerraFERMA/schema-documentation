#eval

type: string

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/cpp/eval*

Overload the eval subroutine for this expression.  This has the standard interface for DOLFIN 
expressions, i.e.:

    void eval(dolfin::Array<double>& values, const dolfin::Array<double>& x, const ufc::cell &cell) const

To automatically evaluate and return the values of the "ExampleCoefficient" in the example in the 
initialization section, all that would be required to write here is:

    examplecoeff.eval(values, x, cell);

(assuming examplecoeff and this expression are of appropriately matched rank, shape and size).
