#value

MULTIPLE (1+) CHOICE 

attributes: name (string) 

*/system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value*

Options for the description of an expression over regions

* [region_ids](value/region_ids "child")

    type: integers

    */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/region_ids*

    A list of the region ids (physical ids in gmsh) that this expression applies to

* CHOICE:
    * [internal](value/internal "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/internal*

        A vector described by an internal derived dolfin expression.

    * [cpp](value/cpp "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/cpp*

        A vector described by a derived dolfin expression using c++ code.

    * [python](value/python "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: string

        */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/python*

        A vector described by a python function.
        
        Functions should be of the form:
        
            def val(x):
              # Function code
              return [..., ...] # Return value
        
         for steady (time independent) expressions or:
        
            def val(x,t):
              # Function code
              return [..., ...] # Return value
        
         for time dependent expressions.
        
        The return value must have the same size as the vector element.

    * [constant (dim)](value/constant__dim "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/constant::dim*

        A constant vector of length /geometry/dimension

    * [constant (arbitrary)](value/constant__arbitrary "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/coefficient/type::Function/rank::Vector/value/constant::arbitrary*

        A constant vector of arbitrary length (must be the same as the size of the vector element).
