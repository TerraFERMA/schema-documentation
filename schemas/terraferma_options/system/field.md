#field

MULTIPLE (0+) 

*/system/field*

Options describing a field (a prognostic function) in this system

* [ufl_symbol (global)](field/ufl_symbol__global "child")

    type: string

    */system/field/ufl_symbol::global*

    The ufl symbol that will be used in ufl forms and functionals to describe the field. 
    This is the potentially sub function of the potentially mixed system function. This ufl
    symbol must be unique across the entire options file as it may be used in any ufl form or functional
    written in this file.
    
    Several additional symbols will be automatically derived from this base symbol:
    
    - trial (ansatz) function = symbol_a
        (the trial basis function, to be used in linear and bilinear forms)
    
    - test function           = symbol_t
        (the test basis function, to be used in bilinear forms)
    
    - iterated function       = symbol_i
        (the iterated function coefficient, containing the most up to date values for the system function)
    
    - old function            = symbol_n
        (the old function coefficient, containing the values from the previous timestep for the system function)
    

* [type (Function)](field/type__Function "child")

    */system/field/type::Function*

    The type of field (no option available).
    
    Fields may only be prognostic functions.

* [diagnostics](field/diagnostics "child")

    */system/field/diagnostics*
