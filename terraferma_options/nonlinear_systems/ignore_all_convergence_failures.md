#ignore_all_convergence_failures

CHOICE 

*/nonlinear_systems/ignore_all_convergence_failures*

Ignore solver failures.  Intended for debugging purposes only!

**Do not use this option in any scientific simulation.**

This option allows the simulation to continue even if the nonlinear systems fail to meet the convergence criteria.

This option does not affect the handling of convergence failures within each system solver.
