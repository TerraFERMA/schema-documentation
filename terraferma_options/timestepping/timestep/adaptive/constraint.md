#constraint

MULTIPLE (1+) 

attributes: name (string) 

*/timestepping/timestep/adaptive/constraint*

Provide the name of a field (and the system it is described in) and its target maximum value.

This should be a Courant number like field so that the timestep is calculated such that:

dt = (current_dt*requested_maximum_value)/current_maximum_value

If multiple constraints are provided the minimum timestep is taken.

* [system](constraint/system.md "child")

    attributes: name (string) 

    */timestepping/timestep/adaptive/constraint/system*

    The system name

* CHOICE:
    * [field](constraint/field.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        attributes: name (string) 

        */timestepping/timestep/adaptive/constraint/field*

        The field name
        
        Field is assumed to be Scalar.

    * [coefficient](constraint/coefficient.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        attributes: name (string) 

        */timestepping/timestep/adaptive/constraint/coefficient*

        The coefficient name
        
        Coefficient is assumed to be Scalar.

* [requested_maximum_value](constraint/requested_maximum_value.md "child")

    type: float

    */timestepping/timestep/adaptive/constraint/requested_maximum_value*

    The target maximum value requested for the above field
