#source (File)

CHOICE 

*/geometry/mesh::Mesh/source::File*

Choose the source of this mesh as an externally generated mesh file.

* [file](source__File/file.md "child")

    type: string

    */geometry/mesh::Mesh/source::File/file*

    Input the filename of a DOLFIN format mesh. 

* [cell](source__File/cell.md "child")

    values: interval triangle tetrahedron

    */geometry/mesh::Mesh/source::File/cell*

    Choose the type of ufl cell

* [cell_destinations](source__File/cell_destinations.md "child")

    OPTIONAL 

    */geometry/mesh::Mesh/source::File/cell_destinations*

    Provide a mapping between region ids and process owner ids.  Only works with ghost_mode == none.
    
    NOTE: Intended for debugging purposes only!  This will read in the whole mesh in serial 
    before distributing it to the processes according to the process -> region_ids map provided
    below.
    
    Region ids assigned to multple processes will be given to the highest rank proces.  Unassigned 
    (or unvisited if run on fewer cores than processes listed in the map) region ids will be assigned
    to process 0.
