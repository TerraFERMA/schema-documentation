#initial_condition

MULTIPLE (1+) CHOICE 

attributes: name (string) 

*/system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition*

Options for the description of the initial condition over a subset of the whole domain

* [region_ids](initial_condition/region_ids.md "child")

    type: integers

    */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition/region_ids*

    A list of the region ids (physical ids in gmsh) that this condition applies to

* CHOICE:
    * [cpp](initial_condition/cpp.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition/cpp*

        A tensor described by a derived dolfin expression using c++ code.

    * [python](initial_condition/python.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: string

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition/python*

        A tensor described by a python function.
        
        Functions should be of the form:
        
            def val(x):
              # Function code
              return [[..., ...],[..., ...],...] # Return value
        
         for steady (time independent) expressions or:
        
            def val(x,t):
              # Function code
              return [[..., ...],[..., ...],...] # Return value
        
         for time dependent expressions.
        
        The return value must have the same shape as the tensor element.

    * [constant (dim)](initial_condition/constant__dim.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition/constant::dim*

        A constant tensor of shape /geometry/dimension x /geometry/dimension

    * [constant (arbitrary)](initial_condition/constant__arbitrary.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/field/type::Function/rank::Tensor/initial_condition/constant::arbitrary*

        A constant tensor of arbitrary shape (must be the same as the size of the tensor element).  
        Values should be entered by row first.
