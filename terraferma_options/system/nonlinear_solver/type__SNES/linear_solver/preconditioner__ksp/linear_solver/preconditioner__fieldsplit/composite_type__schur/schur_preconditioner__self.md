#schur_preconditioner (self)

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::SNES/linear_solver/preconditioner::ksp/linear_solver/preconditioner::fieldsplit/composite_type::schur/schur_preconditioner::self*

The preconditioner for the Schur complement is generated from the Schur complement matrix itself:
The only preconditioner that currently works directly with the Schur complement matrix object is the PCLSC 
preconditioner

Usually for saddle point problems one would use a preconditioner of self and pc lsc 
which uses the least squares commutator compute a preconditioner for the Schur 
complement.
