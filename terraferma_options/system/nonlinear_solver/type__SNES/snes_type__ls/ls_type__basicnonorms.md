#ls_type (basicnonorms)

CHOICE 

*/system/nonlinear_solver/type::SNES/snes_type::ls/ls_type::basicnonorms*

This routine is not a line search at all; it simply uses the full Newton step.  
This version does not even compute the norm of the function or search direction; 
this is intended only when you know the full step is fine and are not checking for 
convergence of the nonlinear iteration (for example, you are running always for a 
fixed number of Newton steps).
