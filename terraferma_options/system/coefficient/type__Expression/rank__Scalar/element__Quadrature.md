#element (Quadrature)

CHOICE 

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/element::Quadrature*

Options describing a piecewise constant quadrature element.

* [family](element__Quadrature/family.md "child")

    values: Quadrature

    */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/element::Quadrature/family*

    Element family
    
    - Quadrature

* [degree](element__Quadrature/degree.md "child")

    type: integer

    */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/element::Quadrature/degree*

    Quadrature degree.
    
    Note that this restricts the quadrature degree of any form in which it appears and must not conflict
    with the degree set in the form.
    
    Importantly, this is the degree of the resulting form not the function itself!

* CHOICE:
    * [quadrature_rule (default)](element__Quadrature/quadrature_rule__default.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/element::Quadrature/quadrature_rule::default*

        The quadrature rule that will be used when integrating the forms.
        
        The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules (in ffc) for triangles and tetrahedra with a degree of
        precision less than or equal to six.  Above this 'canonical' will automatically be used.
        
        The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute the quadrature rule which is based on Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped
        onto simplices.

    * [quadrature_rule (canonical)](element__Quadrature/quadrature_rule__canonical.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/element::Quadrature/quadrature_rule::canonical*

        The quadrature rule that will be used when integrating the forms.
        
        The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute the quadrature rule which is based on Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped
        onto simplices.
        
        The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules (in ffc) for triangles and tetrahedra with a degree of
        precision less than or equal to six.  Above this 'canonical' will automatically be used.
