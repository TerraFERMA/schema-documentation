#value

MULTIPLE (1+) CHOICE 

attributes: name (string) 

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value*

Options for the description of an expression over regions

* [region_ids](value/region_ids.md "child")

    type: integers

    */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/region_ids*

    A list of the region ids (physical ids in gmsh) that this expression applies to

* CHOICE:
    * [internal](value/internal.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/internal*

        A scalar described by an internal derived dolfin expression.

    * [cpp](value/cpp.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/cpp*

        A scalar described by a derived dolfin expression using c++ code.

    * [python](value/python.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: string

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/python*

        A scalar described by a python function.
        
        Functions should be of the form:
        
            def val(x):
              # Function code
              return ... # Return value
        
         for steady (time independent) expressions or:
        
            def val(x,t):
              # Function code
              return ... # Return value
        
         for time dependent expressions.
        
        The return value should be scalar.

    * [constant](value/constant.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: float

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Scalar/value/constant*

        A constant scalar
