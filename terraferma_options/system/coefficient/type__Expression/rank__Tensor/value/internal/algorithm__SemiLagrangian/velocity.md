#velocity

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value/internal/algorithm::SemiLagrangian/velocity*

The velocity that will be used to lookup the value.

This must have the same dimension as the geometry.

* [system](velocity/system.md "child")

    OPTIONAL 

    attributes: name (string) 

    */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value/internal/algorithm::SemiLagrangian/velocity/system*

    The system where the velocity is to be found.
    Assumed to be the current system if left unspecified.
