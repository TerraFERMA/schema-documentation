#value (WholeMesh)

MULTIPLE (1+) CHOICE 

*/system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh*

Options for the description of an expression over the domain

* CHOICE:
    * [internal](value__WholeMesh/internal.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh/internal*

        A tensor described by an internal derived dolfin expression.

    * [cpp](value__WholeMesh/cpp.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh/cpp*

        A tensor described by a derived dolfin expression using c++ code.

    * [python](value__WholeMesh/python.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: string

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh/python*

        A tensor described by a python function.
        
        Functions should be of the form:
        
            def val(x):
              # Function code
              return [[..., ...],[..., ...],...] # Return value
        
         for steady (time independent) expressions or:
        
            def val(x,t):
              # Function code
              return [[..., ...],[..., ...],...] # Return value
        
         for time dependent expressions.
        
        The return value must have the same shape as the tensor element.

    * [constant (dim)](value__WholeMesh/constant__dim.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh/constant::dim*

        A constant tensor of shape /geometry/dimension x /geometry/dimension

    * [constant (arbitrary)](value__WholeMesh/constant__arbitrary.md "child")

        CHOICE 

        type: floats

        */system/coefficient/type::Expression/rank::Tensor/value::WholeMesh/constant::arbitrary*

        A constant tensor of arbitrary shape (must be the same as the size of the tensor element).  
        Values should be entered by row first.
